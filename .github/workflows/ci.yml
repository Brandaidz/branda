```yaml
- name: Upload coverage report for ${{ matrix.app }}
  # Ensure you are using actions/upload-artifact@v3 or later
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    # Use a dynamic name based on the matrix variable to distinguish artifacts
    name: coverage-report-${{ matrix.app }}
    # The path should be relative to the working directory of this step
    # Assuming the working directory is set to the module's folder (e.g., project_code/src/${{ matrix.app }})
    path: coverage/lcov.info
    # This option tells the action what to do if the path doesn't match any files
    # 'warn': The action completes successfully but logs a warning. (Default)
    # 'ignore': The action completes successfully without any warning.
    # 'error': The action fails (this is the behavior without this option).
    # Choose 'warn' or 'ignore' depending on your preference.
